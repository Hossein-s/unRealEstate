This repository holds sample projects for benchmarking and comparing the performance of different
implementation methods for Spring Boot applications, as well as database implementation and load test codes.

These sample projects implement an imaginary real estate listing website, called unRealEstate.

## Implementations
unRealEstate is implemented in three methods:
1. Blocking application
2. Non-blocking application implemented using Kotlin Coroutines
3. Non-blocking application implemented using WebFlux
